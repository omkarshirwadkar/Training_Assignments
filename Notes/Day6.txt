--> UserCreated class should implement AutoClosable interface to be used in try-with-resources statement.
--> No need to call close() method manually

[^abcd] --> contains any character not between a and d (inclusive)
[a-d][p-r] --> 1st character between a and d (inclusive) and 2nd character between p and r (inclusive)
[a-d[p-r]] --> contains any character between a and d (inclusive) or any character between p and r (inclusive)
[a-d&&[p-r]] --> kind of intersection of two patterns, contains any character between a and d (inclusive) and any character between p and r (inclusive)
