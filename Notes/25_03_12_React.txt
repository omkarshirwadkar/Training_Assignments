React
------
Project Structure
Virtual DOM: A lightweight in-memory representation of the real DOM.
JSX: JavaScript XML --> JSX doesn't support if else

                HTML                            vs                            XML
            * Inbuilt Tags                                             * Custom Tags
            * No need to close tags                                    * Need to close tags
            * No need to use namespace                                 * Need to use namespace
            * Case Insensitive                                         * Case Sensitive
            * Static                                                   * Dynamic
            * No proper nesting                                        * Strict nesting
            * <h1></h1><h2></h2>                                       * Must have only 1 root element 
            
JSX Rules
----------
* Just follow all XML rules


Fragments
---------
* Used to group elements together
* <></> is used to create a fragment

Props and State
----------------
* Props: Short for properties. Props are immutable and passed from parent to child.
* State: Mutable and used to store data that can change. State is used in functional components.
