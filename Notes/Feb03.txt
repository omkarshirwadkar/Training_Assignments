Advance Java Features:
-------------------------
record
Enums
for-each loop
try-with resources
sealed class
interfaces with multiple methods with body
Functional interfaces
Lambda Expressions
Method references
forEach() method
Stream API
Date and Time API
Optional API


Interfaces can have default methods with body and static methods with body from java 8.
private methods with body are allowed from java 9.

Functional Interfaces:
-------------------------------------
Functional interfaces are interfaces that have only one abstract method. They can have multiple default methods and static methods.
An interface whose only one method should be implemented
How many of that interface are compulsory implemented --> if 1 then it is functional interface.


Anonyomous Classes:
-------------------------------------------------
Anonymous classes are classes that are defined without a name. They are used to create objects on the fly.
The name of Anonymous class is shown as the class in which it was created with a dollar sign and a number.

why lambda expressions added in java?
------------------------------------------------
Lambda expressions are used to create functional interfaces. They are used to reduce the boilerplate code and make the code more concise.
