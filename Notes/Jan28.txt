Joins are often more efficient for large datasets, while subqueries are more efficient for small result sets. 

#### Joins:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Purpose: Combine data from multiple tables based on logical relationships 
2. Use cases: Retrieve data from related tables, establish relationships between tables, and normalize data 
3. Performance: Factors that affect performance include join order, indexes, and join strategy 
4. Efficiency: Efficient when dealing with large datasets and indexed columns 

#### Subqueries:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Purpose: Break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts 
2. Use cases: Filter data, aggregate data, and retrieve specific rows or values 
3. Performance: More efficient when only a few rows need to be returned 
4. Flexibility: Can be used with various SQL commands, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE 

When to use joins or subqueries:
-----------------------------------
Joins:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Use joins when you need to retrieve data from multiple tables based on a related column 

Subqueries:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Use subqueries when you need to filter data based on complex criteria or retrieve specific rows or values 


Types of joins:
Inner / Self Join
Outer Join: Left Outer Join, Right Outer Join
Full Join
Cross Join

rollup: Aggregate data by grouping multiple columns together
coalesce: Return the first non-null value from a list of expressions
cast: Convert data type of a value or expression
