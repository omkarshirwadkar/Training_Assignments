no short int or long int is allowed 
short int a = 2;

there is no unsignied in Java
unsigned int a = 2;

default whole number is int to make it long add L or l as suffix(prefer L)
long a = 2L;

default real number is double to make it float add F or f as suffix(prefer F)
float a = 2.5F;

Type mismatch: cannot convert from int to boolean
if (condition){
    The condition has to be boolean it cannot be int float or anything else
    Java doesn't convert data types
    strictly type language
}

no const keyword in java
const int a = 10;


Control Statements
1. Condtionals: if, else if, else, nested if, switch
2. Looping / Iteration: for , while, do while
3. Branching / Jumping: break , continue, return, goto (not allowed in Java)

Operators:
Unary, Binary, Ternary

Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, % 
Logical: &&, ||, !
Biwise: ^, &, |
Assignment: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, ^=, &=, |=
Relational: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
Increment / Decrement: ++, --
Shift: >>, << , >>> (unsigned right shift --> shifts even the signed bits to right)
Conditional / Ternary: ? :


A class with the fila name should only be the public class
There can be as many as main method in a class but only one public static void main method is allowed
The classes with the main method are called as application classes or entry point classes, which are used to run the java program
We can have whichever main method we want

The Compiler is the goat
The Compiler adds the default constructor to the class if we don't add it manually.
The Compiler calls the super class constructor before calling the subclass constructor.

Default Constructors job is to assign define values to the unassigned variables.
When 2 variable have same name with different hierarchy then the value of one with the outer scope.
Once a Constructor is provided in a class then the Compiler will not add the default constructor to the class.
this() is used to call the constructor of the same class.
this() must be the first statement in the constructor.


Arrays
In multidimensional arrays the first index that is the row is mandatory
In multidimensional arrays the second index that is the column is optional
