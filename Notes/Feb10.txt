Waterfall works phase wise for the whole project, if one phase is completed then only move to the next phase.
Agile works phase wise for smaller parts of the project, if one phase is completed then only move to the next phase.


Difference between Waterfall and Agile model:
Waterfall model:
- Linear and sequential approach
- Each phase is completed before moving to the next phase
- No change in the requirement once the project is started
Agile model:
- Iterative and incremental approach
- Each phase is completed before moving to the next phase
- Change in the requirement is allowed during the project
