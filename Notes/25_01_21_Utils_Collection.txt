1. Scanner: A class that provides methods for reading input from the user. It is used to get user input from the keyboard, read from a file, or read from a network connection.
--> Keyboard: Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
--> File: Scanner sc = new Scanner(new File("filename.txt"));
--> Network: Scanner sc = new Scanner(new URL("http://www.example.com"));

2. Random: A class that generates random numbers. It is used to create random numbers for simulations, games , and other applications.

3. Date: A class that represents a date. It is used to get the current date, add or subtract days from a date, and compare dates.
The standard date from which it is calculated is January 1, 1970.


4. Stack: A class that implements a stack data structure. It is used to implement recursive algorithms, evaluate postfix expressions, and implement recursive descent parsers.
A stack is a LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure, meaning the last item added to the stack is the first one to be removed.


5. Calendar: A class that provides methods for working with dates and times. It is used to get the current date and time, add or subtract days from a date, and compare dates.
The standard date from which it is calculated is January 1, 1970.

6. GregorianCalendar: A class that extends the Calendar class and provides methods for working with dates and times in the Gregorian calendar. It is used to get the current date and time, add or subtract days from a date, and compare dates.
The standard date from which it is calculated is January 1, 1970.

7. BitSet: A class that represents a set of bits. It is used to store a set of boolean values, where each bit represents a boolean value. It is more memory efficient than using a boolean array. 


Difference Between getMethod() and getDeclaredMethod() in Java:
The getMethod() method is used to get a method that is public.
The getDeclaredMethod() method is used to get a any method, whether it is public or not.

Collection Framework classes:
Used to store and manipulate a collection of objects.
Arrays are static, but collections are dynamic. Collections are used to store a group of objects.

Collection:
    --> Set: A collection that does not allow duplicate elements.
        --> 1. HashSet: A set that uses a hash table to store elements. Stores element depending on the hash code of the element.
        --> 2. TreeSet: A set that uses a tree to store elements. Stores elements in a sorted order.
        --> 3. LinkedHashSet: A set that uses a linked list to store elements. Stores elements in the order they were added.
    --> List: A collection that allows duplicate elements.
        --> 1. Vector: A list that uses a dynamic array to store elements. It is synchronized.
        --> 2. ArrayList: A list that uses a dynamic array to store elements. It is not synchronized.
        --> 3. LinkedList: A list that uses a linked list to store elements. Doubly linked list.
    --> Queue: A collection that follows the FIFO (First In First Out) principle. It is used to store elements in the order they were added.
        --> 1. Deque: A queue that uses a double-ended queue to store elements. It is a collection that can be accessed from both ends. It is an interface that extends the Queue interface.
            --> 1. ArrayDeque: A deque that uses a dynamic array to store elements. It is not synchronized.
        --> 2. PriorityQueue: A queue that uses a priority queue to store elements. Elements are ordered based on their priority.
Map:
    --> 1. HashMap: A map that uses a hash table to store elements. Stores elements depending on the hash code of the key.
    --> Hashmap allows null values and keys.
    --> Hashmap is not synchronized.
    --> 2. Hashtable:
    --> It is synchronized.
    --> It does not allow null values and keys.
    --> 3. TreeMap: A map that uses a tree to store elements. Stores elements in a sorted order.
    --> 4. LinkedHashMap: A map that uses a linked list to store elements. Stores elements in the order they were added.

Enumeration: hasMoreElements(), nextElement() methods. It is used to iterate over a collection of objects.
--> Older version of Java. Now replaced by Iterator.
Iterator: hasnext(), next(), remove() and forEachRemaining() methods. It is used to iterate over a collection of objects.
--> Also supports older version of Java.



Assignment:
--> Take Input of ID from user keep it unique
--> Use Collection Class
--> Add Another Option Search based on ID
