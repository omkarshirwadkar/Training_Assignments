Closure in JS
--------------
A closure in JavaScript is a function that can access variables from an outer function, even after the outer function has finished executing. 
This is possible because the inner function keeps a reference to the outer function's lexical environment. 

Event Bubbling
--------------
Event bubbling in JavaScript is a process that allows events to propagate from a child element to its parent elements.

Higher-order functions in JavaScript are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return functions as results.

Promises
--------
A promise in JavaScript is an object that represents a value that may not be available yet, but will be resolved at some point in the future.

Promise.all(p1, p2, p3).then(.....) --> all promises are kept
Promise.allSettled(p1, p2, p3).then(.....) --> all promises are executed doesn't matter if it is not kept
Promise.race(p1, p2, p3) -->
